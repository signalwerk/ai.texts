# From Translation to Creation

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an essential part of our daily routine and seamlessly integrated into the modern toolbox.

From automatic text translation to image generation and audio processing, AI systems have drastically changed the way we work. In this post, we'll explore how AI has become an essential part of our daily routine and how newer AI systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT are changing the game.

## The integration of AI into our daily routine

AI systems have become ubiquitous in the digital agency landscape, making mundane tasks much more manageable. For example, automatic text translation services, once considered a human-only activity, can now be accomplished with near-perfect accuracy through AI services. We integrate such tools and enhancements daily into CMS (Content Management Systems) to make customers work more comfortable. AI has become a vital tool in the digital age, and its seamless integration is crucial if we want to make the best out of a fruitful combination of human and artificial strengths.

## The Emergence of New AI Systems

Over the past few years, there has been a shift away from expert systems (such as database-supported assistants) to general artificial intelligence models. We now have access to a wide variety of AI systems that allow us to tackle various tasks. With «prompt engineering», we model a context-specific request to a general AI, and it can generate useful results for us. With OpenAI's GPT-3, we can personalize texts based on customer data with «few-shot learning». For exploration and ideation, images can be generated with Stable Diffusion, Midjourney or DALL-E 2 and the people in UX make first attempts with generated layouts from Galileo AI. For text-based audio generation (text to speech), we use Azure services (Microsoft) and Whisper (Open AI) for speech to text conversion. The emergence of new AI systems has enabled us to provide personalized solutions to customers, while classical tools from Meta or Google stay relevant in certain areas of analytics or marketing.

In software development, we used to start a subtask, a project or an idea with the first step. So first you created the "foundation" and then built on it. However, for about two years now, there have been various AI services and models that help us to take this first step more quickly. Instead of, for example, writing the program code for a specific function, today one might rather write a comment and let the AI "guess" the implementation of the function based on this hint. This works surprisingly well in programming and is easy to integrate in our text editors with extensions. So the AI helps to lay a quick foundation while the programmer can focus on the more demanding tasks.

## The future of AI and its impact on work processes

In everyday life with AI, we often have to provide the context, question, or basis to the model. That means we know the problem and now have to judge whether it is more effort to solve the problem ourselves or to explain it to an AI and then improve the generated solution if needed. We know this «overhead» of work already from classical division of labor.

In the future, the integration and understanding of context will be crucial. Artificial intelligence will have to be able to grasp entire projects and systems in order to provide appropriate assistance. Particularly in the exchange between customers and service providers, there will be opportunities to build learning systems and processes, to free humans from tedious and purely executive tasks, and thus to gain time to accompany creative processes for the customer and to curate the results of AI.

## Conclusion

AI has become an integral part of our daily routine, enabling us to work more efficiently and provide better solutions to customers. As new AI systems emerge, they will continue to change the game, and we must embrace their capabilities to provide even better services in the future. While there will be challenges in integrating and understanding the context of a task, we believe that AI will lead to a more collaborative and productive work environment in the future.
